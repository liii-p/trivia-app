# Trivia App
Welcome to the trivia app where you can put your knowledge to the test. This app has been built using React Typescript.

## The MVP
- Create an interface that will allow a user to choose level of difficulty and start a new game
- When game starts, the user should see a question card with 4 possible answers
- If they answer the question correct, a new question should appear on the screen
- If their answer is incorrect, the game is over
- Display the score (number of question answered correctly) at the end of each game
- Add a "Play Again" button under the score

### Bonus
- Allow the user to select a category of questions
- Add a time countdown to each question, when a question is not answered before the time is up, game ends
